# Gezenti

Gezenti is a daily travel game based on the cities of Turkey.

The inspiration for this game comes from another game called Travle, which I personally enjoyed a lot over the last
year.

Back at November 2023, I was playing Travle a lot, and I wanted to play a localized version of it too, to improve
my Turkish geography knowledge while having some fun. However, there were no localized versions available at that time,
so I decided to give it a go. Over the course of a weekend, I developed the initial idea and it was working fine-ish.
However in the following weeks, I haven't had much chance to polish it further, and in a couple of weeks, Travle
announced a localized version for Turkey too, which kinda made this project obsolete. However, over the last couple of
days, I decided to finalize this so I can publish and share the source code, which was my intention from the start
anyway.

While developing this, I wanted to avoid using massive JS frameworks so I can work on my vanilla JS skills too. I have
to admit, it was a bit challenging, but I enjoyed the whole process from start to finish.

I hope you'll enjoy this game as much as I did while developing it.

Got any suggestions or improvements? Pull requests are always welcome.
